### Description

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Example:
```
Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4
```

### Solution

#### Merge Two Sorted Lists

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        head = dummy = ListNode(0)
        while l1 and l2:
            if l1.val < l2.val:
                head.next = l1
                l1 = l1.next
            else:
                head.next = l2
                l2 = l2.next
            head = head.next
        # due to the while condition, only one of [l1, l2] will not be None
        head.next = l1 or l2
        return dummy.next
```

### Complexity Analysis

1. Time complexity : O(n) travese all the elements.
2. Space complexity : O(1) fixed storage used.
