### Description

Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

#### Note:

* Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
* You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```
### Solution

#### Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        # asending order not need to traverse all elements
        # save storage
        head, tail = 0, len(numbers) - 1
        while head < tail:
            total = numbers[head] + numbers[tail]
            if total < target:
                head += 1
            elif total > target:
                tail -= 1
            else:
                return [head+1, tail+1]
```

### Complexity Analysis

1. Time complextiy : O(n).
2. Space complexity : O(1).
