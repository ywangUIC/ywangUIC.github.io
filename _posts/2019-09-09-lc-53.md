### Description

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:
```
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```
Follow up:

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

### Solution

#### Maximum Subarray

```python
class Solution:
    # O(n) solution
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # dynamic programming
        # find the maxSubArray at each position
        # this one only need to return the max sum
        maxSum = currentSum = -sys.maxsize
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            currentSum = max(nums[i], currentSum + nums[i])
            maxSum = max(maxSum, currentSum)
        return maxSum
    
    # divde and conquer
```

### Complexity Analysis

1. Time complextiy : O(n). Iteratively updating two summation through the list.
2. Space complexity : O(1).
