### Description

Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

Example 1:
```
Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```
Example 2:
```
Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.

Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

#### Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeElement(nums, val);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}

### Solution

#### Remove Element

```python
class Solution:
    # pop list element
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        i = 0
        while i < len(nums):
            if nums[i] == val:
                nums.pop(i)
            else:
                i += 1
        return len(nums)

    # two pointer reduce array size by 1
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        i = 0
        n = len(nums)
        while i < n:
            if nums[i] == val:
                nums[i] = nums[n - 1]
                n -= 1
            else:
                i += 1
        return n
```

### Complexity Analysis

1. Time complexity : O(n). Both ii and nn traverse at most nn steps. In this approach, the number of assignment operations is equal to the number of elements to remove. So it is more efficient if elements to remove are rare.
2. Space complexity : O(1).
