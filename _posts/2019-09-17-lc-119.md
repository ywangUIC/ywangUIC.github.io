### Description

Given a non-negative index k where k â‰¤ 33, return the kth index row of the Pascal's triangle.

Note that the row index starts from 0.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Example:
```
Input: 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]
```

#### Follow up:

Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?

### Solution

#### Pascal's Triangle II

```python
class Solution:
    def getRow(self, rowIndex: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(rowIndex + 1):
            # first row, row equal to [1]
            if i == 0:
                row = [1]
            elif i == 1:
                row = [1,1]
            else:
            # start from second row, the head and tail is 1
            # the middle equal to sum of previous row[idx-1] + row[idx]
            # the middle range is from the second element (i) to last second element i
                row = [1] + [ret[j-1] + ret[j] for j in range(1,i)] + [1]          
            ret = row
        return ret
```

### Complexity Analysis

1. Time complextiy : O(n^2).
2. Space complexity : O(n). Only need to store the previous row.
