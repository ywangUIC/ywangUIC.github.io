### Description

Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Example 1:
```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

### Solution

#### Sqrt(x)

```python
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, n: int) -> int:
        # instead of using divide and conquer
        # use Newton's method
        if n == 0:
            return n
        a = float(n) # number to get square root of
        while abs(n*n - a) > 1e-3 : # diff
            n = 0.5 * (n + a / n) # update
        return int(n)
```

### Complexity Analysis

1. Time complextiy : less than O(logn).
2. Space complexity : O(1).
