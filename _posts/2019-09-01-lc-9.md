### Description

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:
```
Input: 121
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

#### Follow up:

Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

### Solution

#### Palindrome Number

```python
class Solution:
    # convert to string, solve with one-line
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        return str(x) == str(x)[::-1]

    # follow-up solutions
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        if x< 0:
            return False
            # use the function written in leetcode 9 to avoid use string
        def reverse(x: int) -> int:
            res = 0
            # memorize the sign of x
            negative = -1 if x < 0 else 1
            x = abs(x)
            while x != 0:
                reminder = x % 10
                x //= 10
                res = res*10 + reminder
            return res*negative

        return x == reverse(x)
```

### Complexity Analysis

1. Time Complexity: O(log<sub>10</sub>(n)). We divided the input by 10 for every iteration, so the time complexity is O(log<sub>10</sub>(n))
2. Space Complexity: O(1).
