### Description

Given a non-negative integer numRows, generate the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Example:
```
Input: 5
Output:
[
     [1],
    [1,1],
   [1,2,1],
  [1,3,3,1],
 [1,4,6,4,1]
]
```

#### Follow up:

Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?

### Solution

#### Pascal's Triangle

```python
class Solution:
    def getRow(self, rowIndex: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(rowIndex + 1):
            # first row, row equal to [1]
            if i == 0:
                row = [1]
            elif i == 1:
                row = [1,1]
            else:
            # start from second row, the head and tail is 1
            # the middle equal to sum of previous row[idx-1] + row[idx]
            # the middle range is from the second element (i) to last second element i
                row = [1] + [ret[j-1] + ret[j] for j in range(1,i)] + [1]          
            ret = row
        return ret
```

### Complexity Analysis

1. Time complextiy : O(n^2).
2. Space complexity : O(n). Only need to store the previous row.
