### Description

You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

Example 1:
```
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

### Solution

#### Climbing Stairs

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        # dynamic programming
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[:3] = [1,1,2]
        for i in range(3,n+1):
            # take 1 or 2 steps back, add the number of ways at that condition
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
        return dp[n]
```

### Complexity Analysis

1. Time complexity : O(n). Single loop upto nn.
2. Space complexity : O(n). dpdp array of size nn is used.
