### Description

Implement strStr().

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:
```
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
```

#### Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

### Solution

#### Implement strStr()

```python
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        index = 0
        if needle == "":
            return 0
        c = needle[0]
        for ch in haystack:
            # only when first letter is same.
            # the algorithm will compare the full needle
            if ch == c:
                if haystack[index:index+len(needle)] == needle:
                    return index
            index += 1
        return -1
```

### Complexity Analysis

1. Time complexity : O(mn) worst case check m times n. m,n the length of haystack and needle
2. Space complexity : O(1) constant space.
