### Description

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```
1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.

Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: 1
Output: "1"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```

### Solution

#### Count and Say

```python
class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n: int) -> str:
        ret = '1'
        for _ in range(n-1):
            temp = ''
            last = ret[0]
            count = 0
            for l in ret:
                #count how many consecutive same number
                if l == last:
                    count += 1
                #break, put the count and the letter to temp result
                #reset letter and count
                else:
                    temp += str(count) + last
                    count = 1
                    last = l
            temp += str(count)+last
            ret = temp
        return ret
```

### Complexity Analysis

1. Time complexity : O(n)
2. Space complexity : O(1)
